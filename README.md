# Protect-Sea-Life

Environment-friendly game where instead of catching fish you are doing the exact opposite, you are catching trash instead.
Every time you get a piece of trash you go up in score but when you catch a fish you decrease in score, there is a time also for the user to see on the top right along with their score at that time and also how many fish it killed.
different speeds and heights the objects spawn at and the speed increases the more scores you get.

Video is involved with the code for anybody to see and look at how it works.
